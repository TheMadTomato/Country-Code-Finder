# Country-Code-Finder
Have you ever been lost by what is the Letter code for certain country is?
Or what country does a certain two letter signify?

And google decided to be stupid and only give you answers through links or AI. 

To Avoid wasting you workflow just to figure how isnt the Country code for Angola "AN"-True story- i Have built a bash script that automate the process to me without the need of any AI or Search engine. Angola is "AO" somehow btw, and and no country have the letters "AN" reserved which makes me angry (/_\).

Don't worry i made a version for window people in powershell as well tho you don't have through the same pain i went through (╥﹏╥).

# Usage 
It is straight forward. You can either search by country code letter or what is formaly known as ISO 3166-1:
```bash 
cn LI # searching for libya for examle
```
> Output: The country for code 'LI' is: Liechtenstein # how the f.... <(ꐦㅍ _ㅍ)>

Or by country name: 
```bash 
cn libya 
```
> Output: The country code for 'libya' is: LY # Bruh....  "( – ⌓ – )
